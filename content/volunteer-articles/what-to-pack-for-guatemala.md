Almost every airline offers 20-25 kilograms of luggage per person as well as 5-10  kilograms of carry-on luggage included in the price of the ticket. You should double check the airline Terms & Conditions when buying the ticket. Of course, you can always choose the pre-purchase excess baggage option.

**15 KILOGRAMS OF DONATIONS**

Every volunteer is obligated to bring 15 kilograms of humanitarian help. Each parcel is put together individually. Normally, it includes medicine, medical supplies (no restricted items and liquids), children’s wear, toys, household goods. Each volunteer is provided with a cover letter from Health&Help, explaining the contents of your donation cargo.

**10-15 KILOGRAMS OF PERSONAL BELONGINGS**

You can always buy necessary clothes in Guatemala or use clothes left by past volunteers. Clothes can be bought for affordable prices ($1-5) at second-hand shops or at the mall. Cosmetics and personal hygiene products are accessible at the local supermarket or at the twice-weekly farmer’s market. It is recommended that you bring practical and comfortable clothes only.

**WHAT NOT TO PACK FOR GUATEMALA**

It’s sensible not to bring unnecessary stuff you can always buy at the local supermarket or find at the clinic. Being a volunteer means to respect local traditions and lifestyles, so please don’t bring any provoking or revealing clothes. There is no need for party dresses and designer gowns. It makes absolutely no sense to bring clothes you are barely using.

**We do not recommend bringing:**

* Revealing or provoking clothes or footwear
* High heels
* More than two pairs of boots
* More than two pairs of pants
* More than one jacket
* Scrubs (there are plenty at the clinic)
* Laptop (one at the clinic can always be used)
* More than $100 in cash (that might be lost or stolen)
* Personal hygiene products (that can be bought at local shops)
* Insect repellents (there are no mosquitoes here)
* Camera (besides, your phone camera is more practical)
* Rain boots (they are heavy and may be bought at the local shop)
* Paper books (though you can bring one for our library!)
* Stationary
* Umbrella
* Raincoat
* Hairdryer/hair styler
* Tent, camping accessories
* Food

Plan carefully before packing. Make a list of things you need to bring and decide who will take what in case you are traveling with a friend. Pack your stuff, folding, rolling and spreading them to occupy all the space inside the bag. Bring multi-purpose items.
