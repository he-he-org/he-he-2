Recently Health&Help has launched a new project in Nicaragua.  We have accepted a tremendous challenge of building a health center and taking new medical volunteers on board and opening a clinic as soon as possible is our common goal.



Health&Help seeks to maintain a friendly atmosphere among its volunteers, striving to make it only better. Our offered Term&Conditions are nurtured through good and hard times, aiming to keep the environment on the project as healthy as it can be as well as to get you familiar with the line of work we do here every day.



A Health&Help volunteer is a leader, deprived of micromanagement and constant control. Being successful at their job, they understand that it is essential to follow certain rules.
