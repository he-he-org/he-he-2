Health and assistance is a non-profit organization that helps the poorest people of the planet. We work where it's scary. Where people have nowhere to go. Where pneumonia and dysentery are taking the lives of hundreds of children, from them, that they could be helped. We are fighting for the right of every person not to die from curable diseases.

# Patients of the clinic

Health and assistance exists through private donations, is not funded by political or religious organizations, and does not receive support from the government.
