WHO emphasizes that all travellers (domestic and international) should be up to date with routine vaccinations.

Travellers should be advised to check that they have been fully vaccinated against measles, rubella, mumps, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough) and poliomyelitis before starting their travel. Non-immunized or incompletely immunized travellers should be offered the routine vaccinations recommended in their national immunization schedules, in addition to those needed for international travel.

Check the vaccines and medicines list and visit your doctor (ideally, 6 months) before your trip to get vaccines or medicines you may need.
