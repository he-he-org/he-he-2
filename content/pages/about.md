Health&Help is a humanitarian aid organization, dedicated to improving the quality of life of people by organizing and providing medical care to those in need around the world.

We provide access to 24/7 direct medical care as well as continually introducing public healthcare programs. We provide health education to the community through one-on-one counseling, lectures and seminars.

This is accomplished through the He&He network, made up of private citizens, government officials, nonprofits, business leaders and others providing support to the project.
