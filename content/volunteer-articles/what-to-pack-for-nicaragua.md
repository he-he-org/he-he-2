Almost every airline offers 20-25 kilograms of luggage per person as well as 5-10  kilograms of carry-on luggage included in the price of the ticket. You should double  check the terms and conditions when buying the ticket. Of course, you can always  choose the pre-purchase excess baggage option.

**15 KILOGRAMS OF DONATIONS**

Every volunteer is obligated to bring 15 kilograms of humanitarian help. Each parcel is  put together individually. Normally, it includes medical supplies (no restricted items and  liquids), children’s wear, toys, household goods. Each volunteer is provided with a cover  letter from Health&amp;Help, explaining the contents of your donation cargo.

**10-15 KILOGRAMS OF PERSONAL BELONGINGS**

You can always buy necessary clothes in Nicaragua or use the clothes, left by other  volunteers. Clothes can be bought at affordable prices ($1-5) at charity shops or at the  mall. Cosmetics and personal hygiene products are accessible at the local supermarket  or at the farmer’s market. It makes sense to bring practical and comfortable clothes  only.

**WHAT NOT TO PACK FOR NICARAGUA**

It’s sensible not to bring unnecessary stuff you can always buy at the local supermarket  or find at the clinic. Being a volunteer means to respect local traditions and lifestyle, so  please don’t bring any provoking or revealing clothes. There is no need in party dresses  and designer gowns. It makes absolutely no sense to bring clothes you are barely  using.

**We do not recommend bringing:**

* Revealing or provoking clothes or footwear
* High heels
* More than two pairs of boots
* More than two pairs of pants
* More than one jacket
* Laptop 
* More than $200 in cash (those might be lost or stolen)
* Personal hygiene products (those may be bought at the local shops)
* Camera (your phone camera is more practical)
* Rain boots (they are heavy and may be bought at the local shop)
* Paper books
* Stationary
* Umbrella
* Hairdryer/hair styler
* Tent
* Food

Plan carefully before packing. Make a list of things you need to bring and decide who takes what in case you are travelling with a friend. Pack a mini capsule wardrobe to make your outfits look creative and fresh every day. Pack your stuff, folding, rolling and spreading them to occupy all the space inside the bag. Bring multipurpose items: shampoo can be used as soap and detergent at the same time.
