In the aircraft or at the airport, you will be given a **customs declaration** where information on donations (‘donaciones’) and/or medical supplies (‘medicamentos’) is supposed to be disclosed. You need to check those points if you are carrying any of the above mentioned items. Here is an example:

You need to give this document to the customs officer when leaving the airport. Your luggage is likely to be checked and x-rayed.

## You need to

**Inform the officers that you are with Health&Help NGO** (I am a volunteer with Health&Help - Soy voluntario de la organización Health&Help);

**Don’t panic;**

**Inform the officers that you are a volunteer and helping the Guatemalan citizens pro bono** (Please, I am helping citizens of Guatemala pro bono - Por favor. Soy voluntario y ayudo a la gente de Guatemala sin ganar dinero);

**Assure the officers that you are giving the donations away, not selling them** (We will give the medicine to our patients; we don’t sell them - Nosotros no vendemos las donaciones. Las damos a la gente enferma);

**Try hard to stay calm and assure the officers you came with good intentions** (Please, it’s for a good cause - Por favor, es por una buena causa);

**If it doesn’t work, please contact your coordinator;**

**Under no circumstances leave donations at the airport. Insist on having no money and being a volunteer, working pro bono** (I am a volunteer. I don’t have money - Soy voluntario. No tengo más dinero).

# Money exchange

You need to **exchange dollars into quetzales** (local currency) in order to hail a taxi or take the bus to Momostenango. Please note that the exchange rate at the airport is not as good as at the bank. Look online for the current exchange rate as it is subject to frequent change.

# Buying a SIM card

![null](/uploads/efv-4072.jpg)

**Find the nearest Tigo office (tienda Tigo)**, using Google maps. Get there by foot or take a taxi. Double check the opening hours.

The sim card costs 5Q (I need a sim card - Nesesito un chip);

Fill it with with data for 100Q (3Gb+whatsapp and facebook free of charge) (I need to fill it with 100Q of data - Quiero poner cien quetzales de saldo);

Dial *123#. Choose Paquetigos para Navegar 2 - Siguiente 0 - and choose 99Q plan.

Reboot your phone and check if the Internet is working.

# In case our volunteers pick you up at the airport

When exiting the airport, a crowd of people will make it hard for you to find the volunteers. We are using a café, situated 20 meters away from the airport entrance.

# In case you are traveling to the site on your own

**Please inform your coordinator about your late night flight in advance**. There is a slim chance you will catch a bus after 3pm, so you need to go to the hotel. There is an option to book a room at [Dai Nonni Hotel](https://goo.gl/maps/Pgm5urVnLHK2) near the airport; accommodation is free of charge for volunteers. There are limitations of the number of stays per month - please contact your coordinator to find out more. In case there are no rooms, you need to book a room in any hotel of your choice.

You will see taxis, parked on the opposite side from the airport. Tell the driver you need to get to your hotel. Tell your driver the address or show it on the map.

“I need to get to ...” - “Me necesito ir al…”

The taxi costs around 50Q (cincuenta). You need to insist on 50Q as taxi drivers tend to overcharge white tourists.

In case you are successfully connected to the wi-fi network, call an Uber: you will save more.

## Direct connection before 3 pm

You will see taxis, parked on the opposite side from the airport. Tell the driver you need to get to the bus stop [“Trebol” (El Trebol)](https://goo.gl/maps/5vBULU2QsD82).

«I need to get to the “Trebol”» - «Me necesito ir para el trebol»;

«The bus to Momostenango» - «Autobús para Momostenango».

The taxi costs around 50Q (cincuenta). You need to insist on 50Q as taxi drivers tend to overcharge white tourists.

After arriving at the “Trebol” bus station, you will see a lot of buses with destination signs under the front window. You need to find the bus going to[ Momostenango](https://goo.gl/maps/YsmqZCwqgBo).

Your luggage must be placed right next to you or under the seat. You will be offered to put the luggage on the rooftop; do not agree as it might be stolen.

# Indirect connection after 3pm

There are no direct buses to Momostenango after 3pm. You need to take the bus to “cuatro caminos”. It costs around 15-20Q.

After arriving at the [“cuatro caminos”](https://goo.gl/maps/ZotXzdy8D3m) bus stop, you need to find a bus to Momostenango. The drivers will help you find the necessary bus. Please make sure to double check the destination sign on the bus you take.

In case you are not able to carry your luggage, you may ask the drivers to help you; be careful and double check that the luggage has been placed inside your bus. It might be stolen if placed on the rooftop.

# How to get to the clinic

After arriving in Momostenango, you need to find ["Lool's Pizza"](https://goo.gl/maps/WAYjhpqy2mv)  or ["Momostipan Cafe"](https://goo.gl/maps/KRUMbgcyYq52). Using the free wi-fi, call our volunteers or coordinating staff in the clinic.

The wi-fi password can be asked from the waiter.
