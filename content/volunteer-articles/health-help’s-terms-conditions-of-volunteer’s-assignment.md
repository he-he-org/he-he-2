Health&Help seeks to maintain a friendly atmosphere among its volunteers, always striving to make it better. Our offered Term&Conditions are designed to support volunteers through good and hard times. We aim to maintain a healthy clinic environment and keep you informed regarding daily work activities and standards.

Our mission at Health&Help is to deliver medical services to the poorest communities by providing affordable and effective healthcare as well as education on public healthcare basics.

**A successful candidate is expected to:**

* Deliver 15 kilograms of humanitarian help (medical supplies and drugs). Depending on circumstance, Health&Help will assist in accruing donations for eventual volunteer delivery.

* Take drugs;
* Smoke tobacco;
* Consume alcohol in public places, on work days, or in the case that there are no sober volunteers;

Please be advised that the contract does not offer reimbursement for travel or any other unspecified expenses. The contract offers you a six-day working week, eight hours every day. Periods of leave are subject to discussion in cases where volunteers sign short-term contracts. Any vacation expenses are covered by the volunteer. Please note that the mission is carried out in a region distant from urban areas; five to seven people tend to participate in the project simultaneously.

Please be advised that our Terms&Conditions offer reimbursement of travel expenses for volunteers who have signed contracts for one-year or longer. Before purchasing your flight tickets or incurring any other travel-related expenses, please contact your Health&Help Volunteer Coordinator.
